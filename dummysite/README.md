# Dummy Site Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

> More info about this process in the REAMDE.md from the examples in the course [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app10-go)

Install kubebuilder and generate CRD files [here](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start)

```sh
curl -L -o kubebuilder "https://go.kubebuilder.io/dl/latest/$(go env GOOS)/$(go env GOARCH)"
chmod +x kubebuilder && sudo mv kubebuilder /usr/local/bin/
```

Init Go inside the `/dummysite/controller` directory and the kubebuilder

```sh
go mod init github.com/lucksei/dummysite/controller
kubebuilder init --domain dwk
```

Create an API for the custom resource with the following command

```sh
kubebuilder create api --group stable --version v1 --kind DummySite
```

> The --group and --domain are filled from the PROJECT file, the domain also has to follow the same requirements to work.
> `Group or Domain is invalid: [a DNS-1123 subdomain must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'my-name',  or 'abc-123', regex used for validation is '[a-z0-9](?:[-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(?:\.[a-z0-9](?:[-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*')]`

The `PROJECT` file should look like this

```yaml
# Code generated by tool. DO NOT EDIT.
# This file is used to track the info used to scaffold your project
# and allow the plugins properly work.
# More info: https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/project-config.html
cliVersion: 4.10.1
domain: dwk
layout:
  - go.kubebuilder.io/v4
projectName: controller
repo: github.com/lucksei/dummysite/controller
resources:
  - api:
      crdVersion: v1
      namespaced: true
    controller: true
    domain: dwk
    group: stable
    kind: DummySite
    path: github.com/lucksei/dummysite/controller/api/v1
    version: v1
version: "3"
```

Modify CRD in the `api/v1/dummysite_types.go` file

Now we write the reconciliation process logic where we create a deployment and a service for the DummySite resource and then apply it to the cluster. This is implemented inside the `internal/controller/dummysite_controller.go` file. By default it comes empty with the following boilerplate code:

Finally run `make` & `make manifests`. To test it out run `make run`

> https://book.kubebuilder.io/getting-started

After building the controller we are ready to deploy it to the cluster. Docs [here](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start#run-it-on-the-cluster)

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=lucksei/dummysite-controller:latest
```

```sh
make deploy IMG=lucksei/dummysite-controller:latest
```

To delete & undeploy the CRD from the cluster

```sh
make unistall
make undeploy
```
